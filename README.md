The OWL Akrida is designed to **load test** deployments based upon DIDComm, such as [Credo](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts) and [ACA-Py](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy.git).

The project uses the [Locust](https://locust.io/) tool in combination with [Credo](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts) to test [DIDComm](https://didcomm.org) based protocols. 

From Ancient Greek ·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒØœÇ, or akr√≠da, means locust or grasshopper.

## Features

- ü¶ó Easy to run load tests distributed over multiple machines using [Locust](https://locust.io/) with the ability to swarm from thousands to hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users.
- üêç Easy to write Python tests
- üì¶Ô∏è Isolated users using greenlet and Node.js environment
- üìÉ Provides a user friendly web interface that shows the progress of your test in real-time. It can also be run without the UI, making it easy to use for CI/CD testing.

## Design 

Typically, three to four types of agents may be involved in a decentralized identity environment. There is typically a large number of holder agents, a mediator agent for the holder agents, and one or more issuer and verifier agents.

Example of a typical environment with a mediator:

![Typical environment with a mediator](./docs/images/holdermediatorissuer.png)

OWL Akrida is designed to take place of the holder agents. This allows OWL Akrida to provide a load on the Mediator, Issuer, and/or Verifier agents.

Example of Locust with a mediator:

See [design](./docs/DESIGN.md) for more design details.

## Getting Started

Before starting any load testing you **SHOULD** gain written permission that includes the time, method and various systems that you wish to load test. You **MUST NOT** load test any system that you do **NOT** have permission to test.

To get started quickly on your local machine, you can try out the [Quick Start Guide](./docs/QUICKSTART.md)

For high concurrency testing, it is useful to run Locust on a VM where you can easily add more resources for bigger tests. Please read [docs/VM.md](./docs/VM.md)
